# Citi Bike Data

## Purpose

This project was created to view and analyze data from the Citi Bike program currently running in NYC to better decide if it is a good fit for Des Moines. Using Tableau, visulaizations were created to help interpret the data. The entire dashboard can be viewed [here.](https://public.tableau.com/shared/FMJ3SQWSD?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Results

Overall, the analysis results look very positive. The first thing to be noted is that the large majority of Citi Bike users in New York are subscribers, and therefore, providing constant revenue.
