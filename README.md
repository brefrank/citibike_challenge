# Citi Bike Data

## Purpose

This project was created to view and analyze data from the Citi Bike program currently running in NYC to better decide if it is a good fit for Des Moines. Using Tableau, visulaizations were created to help interpret the data. The entire dashboard can be viewed [here.](https://public.tableau.com/shared/FMJ3SQWSD?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Results

Overall, the analysis results look very positive. The first thing to be noted is that the large majority of Citi Bike users in New York are subscribers, and are providing constant revenue.

Almost all bike use happens in under an hour. The two graphs below show that the trend is very similar regardless of gender, despite most customers being male.

The following three heatmaps are indicative of weekday utilization. Because the colors are most concentrated on weekdays, with the further breakdown showing 8am and 5pm regardless of gender, it can be inferred that most users are biking to and from work within the city.

## Summary

Despite Des Moines being smaller than New York City, it looks like a bike share program would do well in the city. Marketing and incentives should be catered towards gaining customers that are daily commuters, as they are the primary user. To further solidify this conclusion, it would be suggested to create the same analysis from a cooler month. Additionally, a graph of yearly revenue would aid in determining risk.
